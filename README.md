# Spam-SMS-Detection-using-ML-and-DL-techniques

* Restructured a project on detecting the Spam SMS using machine learning and deep learning techniques
* Cleaned and analyzed the dataset using NLP and visualization techniques such as WorldCLoud in this case.
* Split the data into training set and testing set. And created a LSTM model to train it with the training set.
* Checked the model accuracy for both train and test set. The training set had ~99.9% accuracy and the testing test had ~97.2%
* Reviewed the Classification report and visualized the confusion matrix using heatmap.
